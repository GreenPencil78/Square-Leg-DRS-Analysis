# Square-Leg-DRS-Analysis
This includes our code for analyzing the square leg camera as part of the Decision Review System (DRS) in cricket. The goal of the project was to create a DRS system using phone cameras instead of costly professional ones to capture video. This code uses contour detection based on color to perform ball tracking on the x and y positions of the green tennis ball from the square leg camera's video. It goes through the video frame by frame, identifying contours around the ball, which helps keep track of position. Erroneous detections are avoided by looking at the ball's previous x and y positions to determine if the current position makes sense. Contour detection is also used to track the wicket's position. Based on the ball's position and velocity as detected in the video, the code determines whether it will hit or miss the wickets and outputs a graph showing the ball's predicted trajectory.
